# Change Log

## Initial commit
### why another packer repo?
-- [packrats](github.corp.dyndns.com/automation/packrats) is very loosely related to Bento ... while nothing specifically suggests it's a fork, the work is close enough to suggest it is a fork of bento that was `Dynified` just enough to make it appear to be a different project. 
-- Why re-write and maintain a different approach to building packer boxes, we can build on what they offer

- remove templates and supporting elements for OS we do not use at Dyn
